# Peoject created with React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-   [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
-   [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

`npm install`
Install all dependencies.

`npm run dev`
This command will start the development server and show the React app on localhost.

`npm run build`
Bundles the app into static files for production inside a **dist** folder.

`npm run preview`
Let's you preview the bundled files from the **dist** folder on the local server, which contains the result of running the `npm run build` command.
